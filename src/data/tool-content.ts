      'A word finder is a flexible search tool that lets you comb an entire English dictionary using the clues you already have. Maybe you need a word that starts with "pre", ends in "ing", contains "qu", or is exactly seven letters long — the AllWordTools.com Word Finder combines all of those filters at once and returns every match in an instant, ranked so the longest, highest-value words appear first.',

That makes it perfect for crossword-adjacent searches, for learning new vocabulary, for word puzzles, and for finding that word on the tip of your tongue. And when you do want to restrict results to your rack, simply add the letters you have and the finder will show only playable words.",

          'An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using every original letter exactly once. "Listen" and "silent" are a classic pair — both use the letters e, i, l, n, s and t. Because every letter must be reused, anagrams are stricter than a general word search: a true anagram never adds or drops a letter, it only rearranges what is already there.',
          "That distinction is what separates an anagram solver from a word unscrambler. An unscrambler finds every word you can build from some or all of your letters, including shorter ones.

The solver counts, across all remaining candidate words, how many contain each unguessed letter, then ranks those letters and shows the percentage of words each one appears in. A letter in ninety percent of candidates is a near-certain hit; one in twenty percent is a long shot.",
          "This frequency approach does two things at once: it maximises your chance of revealing a letter, and when the letter is present it usually splits the remaining words into a much smaller set. That is why the top suggestion is almost always your best play, especially early in a round when many words are still possible.",

If you know the word is _ a _ _ e, type it that way — the solver only considers words of that precise length with those letters fixed in place.",
          "The solver also assumes revealed letters appear everywhere they belong, so a blank will never be filled by a letter you have already uncovered elsewhere. Combined with your wrong-guess list, this keeps the candidate set tight and accurate.",

        question: "Is passive voice always considered an error in English grammar?",

If it sounds nonsensical (e.g., 'The CEO signed the contract [by zombies]'), it is active."

For example, in the sentence 'The group of scientists were ready', a primitive checker might accept the plural verb because 'scientists' is plural, ignoring that the true grammatical subject is the singular collective noun 'group'.",

        question: "What is the difference between assonance, consonance, and alliteration?",
        answer: "Assonance is vowel repetition ('fade / lake'). Consonance is consonant repetition anywhere in words ('black / clock'). Alliteration is consonant repetition specifically at the beginning of words ('cool / calm')."
      },
      {
        question: "How do hip-hop artists and songwriters use assonance?",
        answer: "Songwriters use assonance to create multi-syllabic slant rhymes and internal vowel melodies, allowing lyrics to sound harmonious and rhythmic without relying solely on predictable end-rhymes."
      },
      {
        question: "Can this tool help with poetry analysis and homework?",
        answer: "Yes! Students can paste lines of poetry to detect hidden assonance patterns, identify the active vowel phonemes, and understand how poets construct musical cadence."
      },
      {
        question: "Do words have to be spelled the same way to create assonance?",
        answer: "No. Assonance is purely phonetic. For example, 'rein', 'rain', and 'plane' all feature assonance because they share the long /eɪ/ vowel sound despite different spelling."
      },
      {
        question: "Can copywriters use assonance for brand slogans and marketing?",
        answer: "Yes. Slogans featuring assonance are proven to be easier for consumers to remember and pronounce, making the tool popular among branding specialists and copywriters."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I filter assonance words by syllable count or part of speech?",
        answer: "Yes. The generated results can be organized by 1-syllable, 2-syllable, and 3+ syllable words to fit your poetic meter or song beat."
